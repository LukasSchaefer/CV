Two-page Resumes
==========================

These two-page resumes are largely based on [the CV draft of Sebastian Ruder](https://github.com/sebastianruder/cv) with design inspiration taken from [Deedy's CV template](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume).

I further added [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) symbols.

While the industry CV is tailored to industry jobs, the research CV is focusing on research applications.
