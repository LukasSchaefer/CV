Resume
==========================

My personal single-page and two-page CVs.

The two-column single-page CV draft is based on [Deedy's Resume](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume)
while the standard two-page draft is largely based on [the CV draft of Sebastian Ruder](https://github.com/sebastianruder/cv) with design inspiration taken from Deedy's CV.

I also added [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) symbols for a nice stylistic touch.
