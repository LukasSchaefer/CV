\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Transferred domain-dependent policy learning neural network architecture of Action-Schema Networks to
    classical automated planning
    \item Implemented the network using Keras, slightly adjusted its training for classical planning and extended 
    the FastDownward planning framework
    \item Extensive evaluation and analysis was conducted on IPC domains of varying complexity identifying
    limitations in generalisation and scalability
