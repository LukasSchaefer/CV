\vspace{\topsep}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Applied curiosity as intrinsically computed exploration bonuses for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
    \item Implemented count- and prediction-based curiosities to evaluate for value-based and policy-gradient MARL methods using PyTorch
    \item Evaluated and analysed the influence of curiosity on cooperative and competitive MARL involving partial observability and sparse rewards
    \item Applied curiosity led to considerably improved stability and convergence applied to policy-gradient MARL trained with sparse reward signals

% \vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
% \begin{tightemize}
%     \item Transferred domain-dependent policy learning neural network architecture of Action-Schema Networks to
%     classical automated planning
%     \item Implemented the network using Keras, slightly adjusted its training for classical planning and extended 
%     the FastDownward planning framework
%     \item Extensive evaluation and analysis was conducted on IPC domains of varying complexity identifying
%     limitations in generalisation and scalability
