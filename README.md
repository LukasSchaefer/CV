My personal single-page and two-page CVs.

The two-column single-page CV draft is based on [Deedy's Resume](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume)
while the standard two-page draft is based on [the CV draft of Sebastian Ruder](https://github.com/sebastianruder/cv) with design also based on Deedy's CV.
